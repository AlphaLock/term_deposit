## **Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis and Prediction**

**Project Overview**
This project analyzes and predicts the likelihood of clients subscribing to a term deposit based on a bank's marketing campaign data. Using machine learning techniques, the goal is to build a predictive model to assist the marketing team in identifying potential subscribers.

## **Features**
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Insights into the dataset.
   - Identification of patterns, correlations, and anomalies.
2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Selection of important features.
   - Creation of derived features for better predictions.
3. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - Development of machine learning models.
   - Handling imbalanced data.
4. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
5. **Insights and Recommendations:**
   - Key drivers of client subscriptions.
   - Suggestions for optimizing marketing strategies.

## **Datasets**
The datasets are related to phone-based marketing campaigns from a banking institution:
1. **`bank-full.csv`:** Complete dataset with 45,211 records.
2. **`bank.csv`:** A 10% sample of `bank-full.csv`.
3. **`bank-additional-full.csv`:** Enhanced dataset with additional features and 41,188 records.
4. **`bank-additional.csv`:** A 10% sample of `bank-additional-full.csv`.

### **Attributes**
The datasets include 16 input features and one target variable:
- **Input variables:** Client demographics, campaign details, and previous interactions.
- **Output variable:** Whether the client subscribed to a term deposit (`y`: `yes` or `no`).

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** 
  - Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation.
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization.
  - Scikit-learn for machine learning.
- **Tools:** 
  - Jupyter Notebook for analysis.
  - Power BI for dashboard visualization.

## **Getting Started**
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bank-marketing-prediction.git
   cd bank-marketing-prediction
   ```
2. **Set Up the Environment:**
   ```bash
   conda create -n bank-prediction python=3.12
   conda activate bank-prediction
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## **Results**
- The best-performing model achieved an **accuracy of X%** and an **F1-score of Y%**.
- Key features influencing term deposit subscriptions include `age`, `job`, and `previous campaign outcomes`.

## **Insights for the Marketing Team**
- Focus on clients with a positive history of previous campaigns.
- Optimize the frequency and timing of follow-up contacts.
